# Bash_in_7days
In this challenge I will learn Bash scripting in 7 days (1 week )
Bash Scripting Challenge

This is a 7-day challenge I took on to learn Bash scripting and improve my skills as a Cloud Engineer. The challenge involved following a tutorial series by Learn Linux TV on YouTube and creating several projects along the way to practice my skills.
Day 1 - Echo/Read Functions, Variables, Math Functions, If Statements

On the first day of the challenge, I learned about basic Bash scripting concepts such as echo/read functions, variables, math functions, and if statements. To practice my skills, I created two simple projects: a simple calculator script and a script that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Day 2 - Exit Codes, While Loop

On the second day, I learned about exit codes and while loops in Bash scripting. To practice my skills, I created an Universal Update Script that updates Linux distros.
Day 3 - For Loops, Storing Scripts, Data Streams

On the third day, I learned about for loops, storing scripts, and data streams in Bash scripting. To practice my skills, I created a project named File Analyzer that analyzes the file type name and size.
Day 4 - Functions, Case Statements

On the fourth day, I learned about functions and case statements in Bash scripting. To practice my skills, I created a script that manages users (create, delete, and list users).
Day 5 - At and Crontab, Scheduling Scripts

On the fifth day, I learned about at and crontab and how to schedule scripts in Bash scripting. To practice my skills, I created a backup script.
Day 6 - Toolkit for System Admin

On the sixth day, I started working on my final project: a script that contains a toolkit for a system admin. The tools included in the script are:

    Update the system
    Manage users
    Create a backup
    Analyze a file
    Mini disk manager
    Network manager
    Security hardening
    Exit

Day 7 - Final Project

On the final day of the challenge, I finished my final project and improved it by adding more features. The script is a toolkit for a system admin that includes all the tools mentioned in Day 6, and more. The script is open-source and available on my GitHub repository: [insert link to your GitHub repository here].
Conclusion

This challenge was a great learning experience for me and helped me improve my skills as a Cloud Engineer. I look forward to using Bash scripting in my future projects and continuing to improve my skills.
